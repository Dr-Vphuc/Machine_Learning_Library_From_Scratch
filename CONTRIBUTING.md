# Contributing to vp-learn

First of all, thank you for taking the time to contribute to this project! To ensure an efficient workflow, please follow these steps:

## Reporting Bugs
If you find a bug, please check if it has already been reported in the **Issues** section. If not, create a new Issue and describe:
* How does the bug occur?
* What is the expected result?
* Screenshots (if available).

## Suggesting New Features
Have a great idea? Open an Issue and label it as `enhancement`.

## Workflow

1. **Fork** this repository to your account.
2. **Clone** the fork to your local machine.
3. Create a new **Branch** to work on:
   - For new features: `feat/feature-name`
   - For bug fixes: `fix/bug-name`
   - For documentation: `docs/doc-name`
4. Make your changes and **Commit** with clear messages (follow [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/)).
5. **Push** to your fork and create a **Pull Request (PR)** to the `main` branch of the original project.

## Code Writing Rules
* **Language:** English (for variables, functions) and Vietnamese (for comments - your choice).
* **Format:** Please run code formatting tools (Prettier/ESLint...) before committing.
* **Testing:** Ensure that new features do not break existing functionality.

Note that improving the documentation/examples is no less important than improving the code of the library itself.
